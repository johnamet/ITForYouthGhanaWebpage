/**
 * Capsule design language.
 *
 * The signature form is a circular media element merging with a text block
 * into one continuous pill, so the two read as a single object. These are the
 * shared parts, each separately replaceable: a page can use the shell with
 * static content and no slideshow, or wrap the controller around content that
 * is not a capsule at all.

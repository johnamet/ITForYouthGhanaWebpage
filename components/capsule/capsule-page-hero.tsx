 * The standard hero for an interior page: the capsule at rest.
 *
 * This is the homepage hero's composition, minus the slideshow. The circular
 * lens sits contained inside a rounded rectangular glass shell, and the shell
 * sits on the page's own photograph, blurred across the stage behind it: the
 * same frame reads sharp in the lens and soft everywhere else, which is what
 * ties the object to its ground.
 *
 * It previously used the leading-lobe pill on a light band, and that was the
 * wrong form for a hero. The pill's merge mask exists to dissolve the
 * photograph into the shell's fill, so on paper it faded a ghost of the
 * photograph across the headline and left a visible seam where the mask ended.
 * The contained lens has no mask to fade, so the circle stays whole and the
 * text sits on clean glass.
 *
 * It still reads as a quieter object than the homepage: the shell is wider and
 * shallower, it does not move, and the ring around the lens is a closed accent
 * circle rather than a travelling autoplay arc.

/**
 * A 4:5 portrait overlapping the lower-leading corner of a 16:9 plate, as one
 * figure with one caption.
 *
 * The failure it prevents: the treatment is arithmetic, and composing
 * `WideFrame` beside `PortraitFigure` at a call site puts that arithmetic, and
 * the de-overlap below 1024px, into every consumer. Done by hand it drifts:
 * one page overlaps 18%, the next 26%, a third forgets the reserved space below
 * and the portrait is clipped by the following section. It also splits one
 * story across two `<figure>` elements with two captions, which tells a screen
 * reader there are two unrelated images when the point of the treatment is that
 * the place and the person are one subject.
 *
 * The geometry: the plate occupies the trailing 82% of the row, the portrait
 * the leading 33%, so they overlap by 15% of the row, which is 18.3% of the
 * plate's own width. The portrait then drops `translateY(12%)` past the plate's
 * lower edge, and the row reserves `mb-[5%]` (12% of the portrait's height,
 * expressed against the row's width) so the overhang has somewhere to go.
 *
 * The hard constraint, which no code can enforce: the plate must have nothing
 * of interest in its lower-leading corner, because the portrait covers it. This
 * treatment is chosen with the photograph in hand. It is not assigned by a
 * template.
 *
 * Below 1024px the overlap is removed rather than scaled down. A 33%-wide
 * portrait at 360px is 119px, which is not a portrait of anyone. The plate
 * comes first at full width, the portrait follows at two-thirds, and both stay
 * inside the same figure so the caption never separates from either.

/**
 * The considered typographic treatment that stands in for a photograph the
 * content system has not been given yet.
 *
 * The rule this exists to satisfy: a missing image must never render as a
 * gradient, a grey rectangle, or an empty bordered box. A gradient placeholder
 * is worse than an obvious hole because it looks like a design decision, so
 * nobody fixes it. This reads as deliberate typography and still occupies the
 * exact proportions the real photograph will occupy, which is what keeps the
 * layout honest while the media is outstanding.
 *
 * It is also the correct treatment for a named person with no portrait. Never
 * substitute a stock face for someone the page identifies by name.
 *
 * Decorative by definition: there is no photograph, so there is nothing for a
 * screen reader to describe. The surrounding content carries the meaning.
